# Run Once A Day

Run the executables in the `targets` folder only once a day.

> Note: For Windows only.

## How does it works?

Running `RunOnceADay.bat` will run the executables in the `targets` folder.  
If `RunOnceADay.bat` has already been run that day, it will exit without doing anything.

## Usage

1. Place the executables you want to run in the `targets` folder.
2. And run them with;
   * Double-click `RunOnceADay.bat`.
   * Register `RunOnceADay.bat` as startup and run it only at the first startup of the day.
