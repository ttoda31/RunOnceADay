# Run Once A Day

Run the executables in the `targets` folder only once a day.

> Note: For Windows only.

## How does it works?

Running `RunOnceADay.bat` will run the executables in the `targets` folder.  
If `RunOnceADay.bat` has already been run that day, it will exit without doing anything.

## Usage

* Place the executables you want to run in the `targets` folder.

* Double-click `RunOnceADay.bat`.
* Register `RunOnceADay.bat` as startup and run it only at the first startup of the day.

## Supported executables

* .bat
* .exe
* .py (Requires Python environment)
